# Howdy!
I am Zeckmathederg, Zeckma for short, and Zeck for shortest. I create many personal projects for the fun
of it. I have created and maintain a project which is both a passion project and one meant for others -
GLFS (Gaming Linux From Scratch). Check it out if you're interested. Older projects of mine tend to be
abandonware.

# What else do I do?
I make YouTube videos and chat on Discord. If you wanna message me, feel free to hit me up @zeckma on
Discord.
